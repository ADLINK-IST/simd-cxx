SimD has been designed and implemented by Angelo Corsaro
<angelo@icorsaro.net>.  The key goal of SimD, other than making
simpler the use of a powerful technology such as the OMG DDS, is to
explore new DDS C++ APIs for standardization.

Please consider providing feedback and contribution to the SimD
project, and for any kind of question feel free to contact me at
