INSTALL
-------

To install the SIMD source distribution you'll need to ensure that
BOOST is properly installed in your machine and that two environment
variable are pointing to the include and libraries directory for
BOOST. 

Namely:

BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR: points at the include directory
BOOST_LIB_DIR: points at the library directory
SIMD_INSTALL_DIR: points to the place were you want to install SimD.
If you don't set it then SimD will install under the ./local folder.

Once BOOST is properly installed and configured, simply do the following:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$SIMD_INSTALL_DIR ..
$ make install

If you prefer to compiler using clang++ you should configure the project
with the following command:

$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$SIMD_INSTALL_DIR

Then to see if you installation was successful try out a demo:

cd ./demo/ishapes-driver

$ cmake .
$ make

$ ./ishapes-writer 

$ ./ishapes-reader
