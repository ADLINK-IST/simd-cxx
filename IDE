Eclipse
=======

It is pretty straight-forward to generated an Eclipse Project from
simd-cxx, it suffice to execute the following commands:

$ cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_ECLIPSE_MAKE_ARGUMENTS=-j4 .

Then you will start eclipse, disable first automatic build from the
"Project" menu, then choose "File | Import " and select "Existing
Project into Workspace" from the "General" item. Select as root
directory the simd-cxx root directory.
