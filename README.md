simd-cxx 1.0
============

simd-cxx 1.0 is an evolution/revolution with respect to simd-cxx 0.10
The main change w.r.t. v0.10 is the alignement with the ISO C++ PSM
for DDS. 

As announced in the past this change breaks backward compatibility on
some portions of the API and definitively in the namespace structure
(this can beasily worked aournd with using directives).
